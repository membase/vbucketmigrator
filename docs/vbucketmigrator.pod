=item -b bucket id

Operate on the specified bucket id. You may specify a list of buckets
by using , or ; as the separator character, or a range of buckets by
specifying them as [start,stop].

To add bucket 1, 2, 3 and 4 you may use one of the following:

=item -a auth

Use SASL authentication to authenticate user "auth" to the memcached
server. There is no option to provide the password (that would make it
visible for other users by running ps(1). Instead vbucketmigrator will
read the password from standard input. If you don't want to type it in
yourself, you can always fall back to:


echo "mypassword" | vbucketmigrator -a myuser [options]

=item -A

Try to use the tap ack protocol

=item -N name

Use a named tap stream

=item -V

Validate the bucket states in the downstream servers after a
successful transfer of the messages. Please note that this

intended on other memcached engines.
